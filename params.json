This course is meant for students who are experienced programmers in a language other than Python. We will give you broad and shallow exposure to the plethora of tools that may be useful to you in Python, starting at the basics of the language and moving up to scientific computation in Python.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\n\r\nIn this two-day \"course\", we'll introduce you to:\r\n* efficient calculations with numpy\r\n* visualization with matplotlib\r\n* writing functions and modules\r\n* optimization with numpy and scipy\r\n* object-oriented programming\r\n* handling \"big data\" with HDF5\r\n* astronomical calculations with astropy\r\n* version control and collaboration with git and GitHub\r\n\r\n### Getting set up for Bootcamp\r\n\r\nBefore arriving at Bootcamp, we will assume that you have Python and the required packages installed. The easiest way to do that (and I _very strongly_ encourage that you do it this way) is to use the **Anaconda** package manager. [Download and install Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (or [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) if disk space is a concern) **for Python 3**, and then install the dependencies for this course with the following command in your terminal: \r\n```bash \r\nconda install numpy scipy astropy matplotlib h5py jupyter\r\nconda install -c astropy astroquery\r\n```\r\nThis will download and install all of the required dependencies for our tutorials. Contact me if you have trouble getting set up _before_ bootcamp begins (but be warned: I will only provide installation support if you're using anaconda)! If you plan to stick around for the git tutorial, you should also install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).\r\n\r\n### Instructor\r\n\r\n[Brett Morris](http://brettmorr.is) is a fourth-year graduate student of Astronomy and Astrobiology. He maintains the astropy-affiliated package [astroplan](http://github.com/astropy/astroplan/), among others.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nIn addition to the notebooks in this repository, we will use Jake Vanderplas' 2014 Python Bootcamp notebooks, which I've forked [here](https://github.com/bmorris3/2014_fall_ASTR599).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Further reading\r\n\r\nFor additional resources on getting up to speed in Python, I recommend Jake's book _A Whirlwind Tour of Python_, which is [currently available for free](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf). If you're ready to go deeper, there are [many freely available books on Python to try](http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com).",
